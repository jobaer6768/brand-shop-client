This Website is a e-commerce base website. I built this website as a MERN stack developer.

- `For Frontend`: 
    - I used html5, css3, tailwind-css and ReactJs. I used ReactJs and tailwind-css for most of the cases. And I also used DaisyUI for some design part.

- `For Authentication`: 
    - I used Firebase Authentication system.
    - I added email-password login system and google-login system.
    - I didn't add email verification system but I am planning to add it later on.

- `For Data-handling`: 
    - I used MongoDB database for data-handling.
    - used CRUD operation for post, get, update and delete data from database.

- `For Backend`: 
    - I used NodeJs and expressJs for creating API, read from database and send it to the server and also receive the data from server.
